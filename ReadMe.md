# Swipe & Bite

Hyper-personalized meal discovery — swipe right to eat well.

---

## About the Project

Swipe & Bite turns finding your next meal into a swipe experience, like dating apps but for food. You build a profile based on your diet, health conditions, allergies, and goals. Then you swipe through a curated deck of meals — right for "yes," left for "nope." The app figures out whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner on its own and serves meals that actually fit your life.

You can choose to **cook at home** or **order takeout**. For cooking, you get full recipes, ingredients, prep time, and nutrition info. For takeout, the app finds nearby restaurants that serve that meal and links you directly to order.

Every match is saved so you can come back to it. The app also tracks what you've actually eaten and shows a daily nutrition summary.

## Features

- **Swipe to match** — drag cards left or right (or tap the buttons). Liked meals are saved to your matches. You can rewind if you change your mind.
- **Cook or takeout mode** — choose at the start. Cook mode gives you full recipes; takeout mode finds restaurants nearby.
- **Smart meal timing** — the app automatically loads breakfast, lunch, or dinner meals based on the time of day.
- **Onboarding quiz** — set your dietary restrictions, allergies, health conditions, and eating goals once. The app filters everything from there.
- **Match details** — click any saved meal to see ingredients, step-by-step instructions, prep time, estimated cost, and nutrition facts.
- **AI nutrition estimation** — if nutrition data isn't available, Google Gemini fills it in on the fly.
- **Restaurant search** — for takeout matches, the app searches for nearby places that serve that meal using live web search.
- **Eat log** — mark meals as eaten and track your daily calories, protein, carbs, and fat.
- **Settings & profile** — update your preferences, dietary needs, and profile picture any time.
- **Accessibility options** — color-blind mode and reduced motion toggle built in.
